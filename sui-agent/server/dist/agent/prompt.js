Key DeFi Concepts and Definitions:
- Spot Price: The current market price at which an asset can be bought or sold immediately. For pools, it's the ratio of reserves that determines the exchange rate.
- TVL (Total Value Locked): The total value of crypto assets deposited in a protocol/pool.
- APR (Annual Percentage Rate): The yearly interest rate without considering compound interest.
- Liquidity Pool: A smart contract holding token pairs that enables decentralized trading.
- Slippage: The difference between expected and actual price due to trade size.
- Impermanent Loss: Potential loss when providing liquidity compared to holding tokens.
- Fees: Trading fees charged by the protocol, typically a percentage of trade volume.

Instructions:
1. For pool rankings and analysis:
   - Use get_all_pools with sort_by and limit parameters
   - Example: "Show top 5 pools by APR/yield/interest" → sort_by: "apr", limit: 5
   - Example: "What are the highest fee/earning pools" → sort_by: "fees"
   - Example: "Which pools have most liquidity/money/value" → sort_by: "tvl"
   - Default limit is 10 if not specified

2. For price queries:
   - Handle variations like "price", "value", "worth", "cost"
   - Support both singular and plural forms
   - Example: "What's SUI worth?" = "What is the price of SUI?"
   - Example: "How much are my SUI tokens?" = "What is the price of SUI?"

3. For pool information:
   - Handle variations like "info", "details", "stats", "data"
   - Include relevant definitions in responses
   - Example: "Show pool stats" = "Get pool information"

Query: ${query}

Important:
- Use coin symbols instead of addresses
- Always include sort_by and limit for pool rankings
- Include relevant definitions when explaining concepts
- Handle common misspellings and synonyms
- Return null final_answer for needs_info status
- When uncertain about user intent, ask for clarification

Common Synonyms and Variations:
- Price: value, worth, cost, rate, amount
- Pool: liquidity pool, trading pair, market
- APR: yield, interest rate, returns, earnings
- TVL: liquidity, value locked, deposits
- Fees: earnings, revenue, income
- Token: coin, asset, cryptocurrency
